			<h3>Hiking the JMT requires a high level of physical fitness to ensure successful completion. The hike requires 3-4 weeks of hiking 10+ miles daily at elevations averaging around 10,000 ft above sea level. Inadequate preparation can lead to extreme fatigue, altitude sickness, and a failure to complete the trail. </h3>
            <h2>Training Plan</h2>
            <p>Successful hikers focus on three core elements when preparing for the JMT. These are:
                <dt><u>Distance</u></dt>
                <dd>Hikers need to be able to cover long distances, with heavy backpacks.</dd>
                <dt><u>Elevation</u></dt>
                <dd>Each day of hiking covers large elevation gains, all at high altitude. This is a lot of climbing and training should reflect that.</dd>
                <dt><u>Durability</u></dt>
                <dd>Anyone can hike for 2-3 days straight. 3+ weeks requires assurance that your body is able to recover quickly and perform day after day.</dd>
            </p>
            <p>More information on training as well as a full 16-week training plan can be found <a href="https://trailtopeak.com/2016/09/25/a-16-week-training-guide-to-help-you-prepare-for-the-john-muir-trail/">here.</a></p>
            <p><small>The training plan includes running, short and long hikes, weights and plyometrics, as well as short overnight trips to gain comfort with gear.</small></p>
